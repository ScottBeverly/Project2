## Project Description

A breif description of what i would like to do is to create a real time sports stats app. The Nhl is  my favorite sport so i figured why not create an app with the stats of the players we watch on tv. i plan on fetching an api of stats for this and maping over the object of data to pin point what the people want to see! 

## API
